# Dog-Breed-Prediction

The Dog Breed Prediction System using Machine Learning is designed to automatically identify the breed of a dog from an input image. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system extracts relevant features from images and accurately classifies them into predefined dog breed categories. The model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising various breeds to ensure high generalization and performance. This system has practical applications in pet adoption platforms, veterinary services, and mobile apps, offering a fast and reliable way to determine breed information. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in solving real-world classification problems in the domain of animal recognition.
