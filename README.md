# Dog-Breed-Prediction

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to identify dog breeds from images
using Python and TensorFlow. It provides a step-by-step guide to constructing a convolutional
neural network (CNN) from scratch, covering essential steps such as data loading, image
preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation. The goal is to classify dog breeds
accurately by leveraging deep learning techniques, making it an excellent resource for those
interested in computer vision and image classification.

The project emphasizes practical implementation, allowing users to experiment with different
model architectures and hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, to optimize
performance. It includes a dataset of dog images, which is preprocessed and augmented to
improve model generalization. The trained model is evaluated on a test set, providing insights
into its accuracy and effectiveness.

By combining theoretical concepts with hands-on coding, this project serves as an educational
tool for understanding how deep learning models are built and fine-tuned for real-world tasks. It
is suitable for beginners and enthusiasts looking to explore the applications of deep learning in
image recognition.
